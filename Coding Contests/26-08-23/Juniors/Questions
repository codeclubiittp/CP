** Q1) STRING WORLD **

Rohan have two strings a and b consisting of lowercase characters. Your task is help him to check whether his two strings are an anagram of each other or not. An anagram of a string is another string that contains the same characters, only the order of characters can be different. For example, act and tac are an anagram of each other.

Input Format:
The first line contains a string a denoting Rohan's first string.
The second line contains a string b denoting Rohan's second string.

Constraints:
1 ≤ |a|,|b| ≤ 10^5

Output Format:
If the strings are anagrams you have to return YES or else return NO.




** Q2) UNITE THE ARRAY **

Given two arrays a[] and b[] of size n and m respectively. The task is to find the number of elements in the union between these two arrays.

Union of the two arrays can be defined as the set containing distinct elements from both the arrays. If there are repetitions, then only one occurrence of element should be printed in the union.

Input Format:
The first line contains two integer n and m denoting the size of array a and array b respectively.
The second line contains n integers , elements of array a.
The third line contains m integers , elements of array b.

Constraints:
1 ≤ n, m ≤ 10^5
0 ≤ a[i], b[i] < 10^5

Output Format:
Print an integer ->the number of elements in the union of the given two array.




** Q3) LIFE WITHOUT LOOP **

Rohan, your number enthusiast friend, has a task for you: Can you print numbers from 1 to N without using loops? In simlple words given an integer N,you need to print the numbers from 1 to N without the help of loops.

Input Format:
The first and only line of input contains an integer N.

Constraints:
1 <= N <= 1000

Output Format:
Print the numbers from 1 to N in a single line (In order starting from 1), separated by spaces.




** Q4) MAGICAL NUMBER MULTIPLICATION **

Given two numbers as strings s1 and s2. Calculate their Product.

Note: The numbers can be negative and You are not allowed to use any built-in function or convert the strings to integers. There can be zeros in the begining of the numbers.

Input Format:
The first and only line of the input contains two strings, s1 and s2, representing the numbers whose product needs to be calculated.

Constraints:
1 ≤ length of s1 and s2 ≤ 10^3

Output Format:
Output the Product of the given two strings as a string.
